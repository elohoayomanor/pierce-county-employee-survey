## Conclusion and Recomendations
The employee survey provides valuable insights. Employees understand their roles and feel supported by supervisors, but lack personal connections at work and feel under-recognized. To elevate satisfaction from the current 77% average, employers should focus on human connection, appreciation, and targeted support in lower-performing departments and roles.
